# DLS-Player-Search

This is a work-in-progress. Note that the database has still not been updated for the DLS24 update.

Search for Dream League Soccer players out of a database of 800+ players. This project makes use of a DLS player database by @theshinramen on Github : https://github.com/theshinramen/DLS-Files.


### Instructions:

This application can either be run locally or via the hosted github pages [link](https://jasonel1.github.io/DLS-Player-Search/). You will then be able to search for players in the DLS database by first name, last name, or both. To search, either press enter on your keyboard or click the enter button in the application. A list of the players in the database meeting the search criteria will then be displayed, along with their position, flag, height, dominant foot, overall rating, and stats.
